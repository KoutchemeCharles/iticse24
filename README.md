# Open Source Language Models Can Provide Feedback

Repository for the paper "Open Source Language Models Can Provide Feedback: Evaluating LLMsâ€™ Ability to Help Students Using GPT-4-As-A-Judge" published at ITICSE24.

This repository provides the code used to produce the feedback and evaluating the grading. 
Because the data used in the study is private, this code is not *reproducable*.
It only serves as an illustration of the pipeline applied in the paper.
